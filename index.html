          <li>Humans have used plants native to the Amazon River, such as Clavillia and Icoja Bark, as medicine for generations.</li>
          <li>People have settled the Amazon for hundreds of years. Major population centers such as Iquitos and Manaus rely on the river for the succes of their communities.</li>
          <li>The Amazon is a huge energy source for those in South America. The Itaipú Dam provides 12,600 megawatts of power, more than enough to power all of New York City.</li>

          <li>The land belonging to native Amazonians is shrinking. Less than 100 Tagaeri natives still continue to live their nomadic styled lives.</li>
          <li>Huge wildfires are no longer an oddity in the Amazon. As people continue to deforest the Amazon using fire, accidental wildfire have become common.</li>
